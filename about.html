    <p class="mission">
      SouthGate Protection CIC operates under a clear mandate: to deliver professional security,
      strengthen community resilience, and provide visible, decisive protection across the Croydon borough.
    </p>

    <h2>About SouthGate Protection CIC: The Mandate for Community Safety</h2>
    <p>
      SouthGate Protection is a Community Interest Company (CIC) founded on the principle of unwavering
      commitment to public safety. We strategically combine expert, professional security operations with
      deep community engagement to build measurable safety and resilience across the Croydon borough.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Guiding Principles</h2>
    <p>Our mission is defined by three core principles:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Strategic Deterrence</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Community Trust</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Decisive Harm Reduction</strong></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      We are dedicated to protecting all residents while providing visible reassurance and specialised
      support to vulnerable groups, including women, children, and the elderly. Every action we take is
      executed with integrity, professionalism, and compassion.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Founded by <strong>Rashell Ali Chowdhury</strong>, SouthGate Protection was created to address crucial gaps in
      community safety and support for those who may need extra protection. With a focus on proactive,
      specialised patrols and strategic partnerships with trusted local organisations, we aim to transform
      Croydon into a safer, more resilient borough where residents can live, work, and thrive.
    </p>

    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Critical Hour Security Operations:</strong> Regular, professional patrols focused on high-risk or vulnerability periods, strategically deterring crime and providing immediate reassurance to residents.</li>

      <li><strong>Strategic Partnerships & Collaboration:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Faron Paul / FazAmnesty:</strong> We work closely with FazAmnesty on impactful, community-focused initiatives that facilitate the safe surrender of weapons, directly reducing risks on our streets.</li>
          <li><strong>Croydon Community Action Guardians (CCAG):</strong> We collaborate with CCAG to safeguard young people during after-school hours, ensuring reassurance, safety, and a secure journey home.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>

      <li><strong>Education & Awareness:</strong> We provide clear guidance and resources focused on personal safety and proactive crime prevention, empowering the public.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Impact</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Successfully assisted hundreds of residents across Croydon.</li>
      <li>Supported and led knife amnesty operations, including a major event at the Notting Hill Carnival which resulted in <strong>14 confidential weapon surrenders</strong> in one weekend.</li>
      <li>Built strong, trusted relationships with local organisations and the community, reinforcing safety and public confidence.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why We Do It</h2>
    <p>
      We believe every individual deserves to feel safe and protected in their own environment. By combining
      expert security operations, deep community engagement, and strategic partnerships, SouthGate Protection
      delivers safer streets, stronger neighbourhoods, and dedicated support to those who need it the most.
