    <p>
      At SouthGate Protection CIC, our mission is simple: safety, visibility, and community trust. We patrol local streets to protect all residents, while providing extra care and support to groups such as women, children, and the elderly. Every action we take is guided by integrity, professionalism, and compassion.

    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>
      Founded by <strong>Rashell Ali Chowdhury</strong>, SouthGate Protection CIC was created to address gaps in community safety and support for those who may need extra help. With a focus on proactive patrols and partnerships with local organizations, we aim to make Croydon a safer place for everyone to live, work, and thrive.

      <li><strong>Community Patrols:</strong> Regular and visible patrols to deter crime and reassure residents.</li>
      <li><strong>Partnerships & Collaboration:</strong> Working with organizations like Faron Paul/FazAmnesty to raise awareness and run initiatives such as knife amnesties.</li>
      <li><strong>Education & Awareness:</strong> Providing guidance and resources to the public on personal safety and crime prevention.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Our Impact</h2>
